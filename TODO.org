*** TODO Implementations required
    + Shane Kerr and Peter Spacek pointed out new dnsop convention is to
      have implementations.

* Shane Kerr's review

    Dear DNS colleagues,

    I definitely agree with George that last call seems a bit
    premature. As he points out, section 6 is a large open question. We
    need to either change EDNS behavior to allow an unsolicited EDNS
    option in a response or change this draft to include an appropriate
    EDNS option when it queries. Personally I think the draft should
    specify that the query should include an empty version of this EDNS
    option to indicate support (this is actually helpful, as it doesn't
    make too much sense sending back extra information that clients will
    ignore, decades of BIND adding useless ADDITIONAL section data
    notwithstanding).

*** DONE Plus there's also this odd bit of stray text laying around:
    :LOGBOOK:  
    - State "DONE"       from ""           [2018-12-17 Mon 16:09]
    :END:      

     Here is a reference to an "external" (non-RFC / draft) thing:
     ([IANA.AS_Numbers]).  And this is a link to an
     ID:[I-D.ietf-sidr-iana-objects].

     + Result: removed

*** DONE Also is this correct:
    :LOGBOOK:  
    - State "DONE"       from ""           [2018-12-17 Mon 16:09]
    :END:      

       	 o  OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets ((defined in [RFC6891]) contains the
            length of the payload (everything after OPTION-LENGTH) in octets
            and should be 4.

      If I am correct there are at least 6 octets after the OPTION-LENGTH
      and possibly more if EXTRA-TEXT is present.

      + Result: fixed text to say "OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets ((defined
        in [RFC6891]) contains the length of the payload (everything
        after OPTION-LENGTH) in octets and should be 6 plus the length
        of the EXTRA-TEXT section (which may be a zero-length
        string)."

*** DONE Also, this text seems a bit unclear:
    :LOGBOOK:  
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2018-12-17 Mon 16:24]
    :END:      

       	 R - Retry  The R (or Retry) flag provides a hint to the receiver that
            it should retry the query, probably by querying another server.
            If the R bit is set (1), the sender believes that retrying the
            query may provide a successful answer next time; if the R bit is
            clear (0), the sender believes that it should not ask another
            server.

      The "probably by querying another server" is odd. In my mind it should
      explicitly apply to querying another server ONLY.

      + Result: that's fair.  Changed it to " it should retry the
        query to another server."

      The draft refers to EXTRA-TEXT twice, and EXTRA-INFO once which is
      presumably meant to be the same thing. 

      + Result: switched to all EXTRA-TEXT

    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2018-12-18 Tue 10:32]
    :END:      

      In any case, I think the encoding of this field should be
      specified as either ASCII or UTF-8. I prefer UTF-8, because
      otherwise I won't be able to send back 🤯 emoji in error messages
      (and the authors won't be able to use the 🍄 emoji that they
      clearly want).

      + Resolution: we're proposing ASCII to keep the protocol simple
        and to match TXT records.  These are not intended to be end
        user messages but rather administrative hints for operators.
        + Update <2019-01-02 Wed>: later in the mailing list, people
          agreed on UTF-8.  -- document updated

      + resulting text:

          A variable length, ASCII encoded, EXTRA-TEXT field
          holding additional textual information. It may be zero
          length when no additional textual information is
          included.

      While the draft suggests that it is possible to add multiple EDE to a

            EDNS0 records in a response in order to provide additional error
            information, the RESPONSE-CODE MAY be a different RCODE.

      It is not explicit about how this is done. If the intention is for a
      resolver to forward this back to a stub resolver, then it needs to be
      mentioned, probably in section 3, something like this. However, then
      we also need some text describing how a client behaves when presented
      with multiple EDE.

*** CANCELED Implementation required

      Finally, do we have any implementations of this draft? It seems pretty
      straightforward, but I don't actually think that it's possible to
      develop interoperable code with the draft as it stands today. I
      vaguely recall that we wanted running code going forward to try to

    RFC 8126 contains exactly the guidance you're looking for. When
    creating a new registry you not only need to specify the schema and
    the initial rows to populate the new table with (as you started in
    section 5.2, although the formatting of the table is a bit
    horrifying); you also need to specify the name of the registry,
    required information for future additions and the registration policy.

    Happy to contribute some text if that seems useful.

I like the Extended Error Code using EDNS idea. This was effectively
what was done with TSIG and TKEY that have an expanded Error field

    codes, which provide more detail beyond the top level Error code

    way, wherever you get a DNS Error code (from RCODE or the EDNS

  I tend to think it would be a good idea to separate the case where the
  policy was decided by the resolver and the case where the policy came
  from outside, typically from the local law (see RFC 7725 for a similar
  case with HTTP).

  Rationale: in the first case (local policy of the resolver), the user
  may be interested in talking with the resolver admin if he or she
  disagrees with the blocking. In the second case, this would be useless.

    I really think it is important to make the difference between:

    SERVFAIL Extended DNS Error Code 8 - No reachable authority 

       The resolver could not reach any of the authoritative name servers
       (or they refused to reply).  The R flag should be set.

    Rationale: in draft -04, all SERVFAIL extended error codes are for
    DNSSEC issues. In my experience, SERVFAIL happens also (and quite
    often) for routing issues (most zones have all their authoritative
    name servers in only one AS, sometimes even one prefix or, worse, one
    rack).

    We set the R flag because another resolver may not have the same
    routing issues, BGP not being consistent between all sites.

    True, an extended error code could be added after the RFC is
    published, through "Specification required" but 1) it is easier to do

              might be a good reasons but we need to state them explicitly otherwise
              it will get ignored (or misunderstood).

              Unfortunatelly I have trouble understanding intent behind this

      + Response: 

      We'll work on the wording, and I can hopefully address your
      issue with the lack of clarity with the text and I thank you for
      pointing out that it's not clear.

      In the past, the WG has discussed (more than once) whether to
      and how to divide up the error code range.  There are some
      slides from past IETF meetings, as well as past conversations on
      the mailing list (see the conversation with Donald Eastlake, for
      example).  A few thoughts that came out of the discussions
      centered around multiple points:

      - the desire to include an organized set of error codes grouped
        by RCODE
      - most of the time, the extended error codes would be directly
        related to a particular RCODE (you found an exception)
      - There was a desire to include multiple extended error codes
        within a response, and sometimes it may be beneficial to
        return an error code associated with another RCODE as a
        supplemental error code.
      - If two RCODEs needed a similar extended error, there is no
        reason you can't create two separate (likely identical)
        extended error codes attached to two RCODE values.
      - Packing it all into a single 16-bit integer/short width field
        meant implementations could treat the combination as a
        double-lookup table if they'd prefer, or as a single 16-bit
        error code and it should work either way, providing
        implementations greater flexibility.        

      Hopefully that makes sense?  I've added your new proposed stale
      codes, as mentioned below.

      I've changed the text for RESPONSE-CODE and INFO-CODE in order
      to hopefully help.  I'd love your thoughts and suggestions for
      improvements though.

       algorithms.  So the client (stub resolver) should keep trying.

*** DONE indeterminate should be NOERROR
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-03-10 Sun 22:48]
    :END:

     This should be in NOERROR category.

     AFAIK Indeterminate state is not an error, it is most likely a
     configuration choice on the resolver. E.g. DNSSEC-validating resolver
     running without any trust anchor is in Indeterminate state.

     + Result: You're right, it should be (according to 4033).


     --- New code points ---

     I propose to add couple more codes:

*** DONE new code: NSEC missing
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-03-10 Sun 22:53]
    :END:
     + SERVFAIL Extended DNS Error Code 8 - NSEC Missing
        The resolver attempted to perform DNSSEC validation, but the
        requested data were missing and covering NSEC was not provided.
        RETRY=0

     + status: good idea and added.  I set the retry bit, though, as
       another resolver may not have the same issues, or may have NSEC
       data cached.

*** DONE new code: Cached error
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-03-10 Sun 23:10]
    :END:

     + SERVFAIL Extended DNS Error Code 9 - Cached Error
        The resolver has cached SERVFAIL for this query.
        RETRY=1
     Often the SERVFAIL comes from cache which is unlikely to contain
     specific error details, but it is still useful to distinguish "proper"
     cached SERVFAIL from other weird errors like running out of file
     descriptors etc. Info text could contain remaining TTL ...

     + status: added

*** DONE new code: server not ready
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-03-10 Sun 23:10]
    :END:
     + SERVFAIL Extended DNS Error Code 10 - Server Not Ready
         Server is not up and running (yet). RETRY=1

     + status: added

*** DONE new code: depricated
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-03-10 Sun 23:30]
    :END:

     + NOTIMP Extended DNS Error Code 1 - Deprecated
     Requested operation or query is not supported because it was deprecated.
     Retrying request elsewhere is unlikely to yield any other results.
     RETRY=0
     Intended use:
     - OPCODE=IQUERY
     - OPCODE=QUERY QTYPE={ANY, RRSIG, MAILA, MAILB} etc.

     + status: Added.   Was tempted to set R=1 because other servers
       may support it, but the reality is that if its deprecated it
       shouldn't be used at all.

     --- More adventurous proposals ---
*** new flags 

     a) Two more bits to implement "advice for user" (longer explanation can
     be found in archives
     https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsop/b3wtVj_aWm24PXyHr1M9NMj3LJ0)

     I believe this will make the draft way more useful for everyone and not
     just geeks.

     Proposed addition to text:

     > 2.  Extended Error EDNS0 option format
           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
        4: | R | N | F |                  RESERVED                         |
           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
proposal
***** NOCHANGE NEAR flag

        o  The NEAR flag, 1 bit; the NEAR bit (N) indicates a flag defined
           for use in this specification.

***** NOCHANGE FAR flag

        o  The FAR flag, 1 bit; the FAR bit (F) indicates a flag defined
           for use in this specification.

     > 3.  Use of the Extended DNS Error option

     3.2.  The N (Near) flag   The N (Near) flag indicates that the error
     reported is likely caused
        by conditions "near" the sender. Value 1 is a hint for user interface
        that user should contact administrator responsible for local DNS.

        For example, an DNS resolver running on CPE will set N=1 in its
        error responses if it detects that all queries to upstream DNS
        resolver timed out. This likely indicates a link problem and must be
        fixed locally.

        Another example is an DNSSEC-validator which detects that query
        ". IN NS" fails DNSSEC validation because signature is expired
        or not yet valid. This most likely indicates misconfigured system
        time and needs to investigated and fixed locally.


     3.3. The F (Far) flag
        The F (Far) flag indicates that the error reported is likely caused
        by conditions on the "far" end, i.e. typically authoritative side or
        upstream forwarder. Value 1 is a hint for user interface to display
        message suggesting user to contact operator of the "far end" because
        it is unlikely that local operator can fix the problem.

        For example, an DNS resolver might set F=1 if all authoritative
        servers for a given domain are lame.


***** NOCHANGE Response to both:     

      These seem interesting on the face, and potentially useful for
      receivers as you indicate.  However, they also seem subjective
      and hard to be deterministic about when and how to set them.
      Additionally, most errors should already give a hint as to
      whether a given error is near or far based on the error itself
      (even better hints might be put into the EXTRA-TEXT field).

      I'd (we'd) love to hear other WG member opinions on this subject.

*** NOCHANGE optional TTL to the option

     b) Another thing to consider is adding optional TTL value to EDE option.
     E.g. there is no point in retrying the query again and again until bogus
     response is cached. It is much better to display error message "try
     again in 10 seconds, if the problem persists call X" than just "try again".

     What do you think?

     + Result (Wes): So, I think this adds too much complexity to the
       system that we're otherwise trying to keep simple.  If
       particular errors are likely to be retried successfully after a
       certain period of time, text could be added to the error
       descriptions to hint at that instead.  Otherwise we're adding
       another layer of caching, which spells a lot more code I'd think.

*** DONE answer with stale data
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "NOCHANGE"   [2019-03-11 Mon 14:38]
    :END:

    Yet another code proposal:
    * answer with stale data

       The resolver was unable to resolve answer within its time limits and
       decided to answer with stale data instead of answering with an error.
       This is typically caused by problems on authoritative side, possibly
       as result of an DoS attack. Retrying is likely to cause load and not
       yield a fresh answer, RETRY=0.

    Here is a problem that this code point is applicable to NOERROR as well
    as NXDOMAIN answers so I'm not sure how to categorize it. This
    reinforces my unanswered question why the draft proposes to copy RCODE
    into EDE.

    + Result: Added two codes, one per RCODE, per discussion above.

* Other stuff

ODO SHOULD all r flag suggestions
