    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an extensible method to return
      additional information about the cause of DNS errors. Though
      created primarily to extend SERVFAIL to provide additional
      information about the cause of DNS and DNSSEC failures, the
      Extended DNS Errors option defined in this document allows all
      response types to contain extended error information.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction and background">
      <t>There are many reasons that a DNS query may fail, some of
      them transient, some permanent; some can be resolved by querying
      another server, some are likely best handled by stopping
      resolution.  Unfortunately, the error signals that a DNS server
      can return are very limited, and are not very expressive. This
      means that applications and resolvers often have to "guess" at
      what the issue is - e.g. was the answer marked REFUSED because
      of a lame delegation, or because the nameserver is still
      starting up and loading zones? Is a SERVFAIL a DNSSEC validation
      issue, or is the nameserver experiencing a bad hair day?</t>

      <t>A good example of issues that would benefit by additional error
      information are errors caused by DNSSEC validation issues. When a stub
      resolver queries a DNSSEC bogus name (using a validating resolver), the
      stub resolver receives only a SERVFAIL in response. Unfortunately,
      SERVFAIL is used to signal many sorts of DNS errors, and so the stub
      resolver simply asks the next configured DNS resolver. The result of
      trying the next resolver is one of two outcomes: either the next
      resolver also validates, a SERVFAIL is returned again, and the user gets
      an (largely) incomprehensible error message; or the next resolver is not
      a validating resolver, and the user is returned a potentially harmful
      result.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to extend (or annotate) DNS
      errors to provide additional information about the cause of the error.
      These extended error codes are specially useful when received
      by resolvers, to return to stub resolvers or to downstream
      resolvers. Authoritative servers MAY parse and use them, but
      most error codes would make no sense for them.  Authoritative
      servers may need to generate extended error codes though.</t>

    <section title="Use of the Extended DNS Error option">
      <t>The Extended DNS Error (EDE) is an EDNS option. It can be included
        in any response (SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, REFUSED, etc) to a query that
        includes OPT Pseudo-RR <xref target="RFC6891" />.
        This document includes a set of initial
        codepoints (and requests to the IANA to add them to the registry), but
        is extensible via the IANA registry to allow additional error and
        information codes to be defined in the future.</t>

      <t>The fields of the Extended DNS Error option are defined
      further in the following sub-sections.</t>

      <section title="The INFO-CODE field">
          <t>This 16-bit value, encoded in network (MSB) byte order,
          provides the additional context for the RESPONSE-CODE of the
          DNS message. The INFO-CODE serves as an index to the
          "Extended DNS Errors" registry <xref target="IANA" />.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The EXTRA-TEXT field">
          <t>The UTF-8-encoded, EXTRA-TEXT field may be zero-length,
          or may hold additional information useful to network
          operators.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Defined Extended DNS Errors">
      <t>This document defines some initial EDE codes. The mechanism
      is intended to be extensible, and additional code-points can be
      registered in the "Extended DNS Errors" registry <xref
      target="IANA" />.  The INFO-CODE from the EDE EDNS option is used
      to serve as an index into the "Extended DNS Error codes" IANA
      registry, the initial values for which are defined in the following
      sub-sections.</t>

      <section anchor="errother" title="Extended DNS Error Code 0 - Other">
	      <t>The error in question falls into a category that does

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Though DNSSEC continues to be deployed, unfortunately a
      significant number of clients (~11% according to <xref
      target="GeoffValidation"/>) that receive a SERVFAIL from a
      validating resolver because of a DNSSEC validaion issue will
      simply ask the next (potentially non-validating) resolver in
      their list, and thus don't get any of the protections which
      DNSSEC should provide.  This is very similar to a kid asking his
      mother if he can have another cookie. When the mother says "No,
      it will ruin your dinner!", going off and asking his (more
      permissive) father and getting a "Yes, sure, have a
      cookie!".</t>

      <t>This information is unauthenticated information, and an attacker (e.g
      MITM or malicious recursive server) could insert an extended error
      response into already untrusted data &mdash; ideally clients and
      resolvers would not trust any unauthenticated information, but until we
      live in an era where all DNS answers are authenticated via DNSSEC or
      other mechanisms, there are some tradeoffs. As an example, an attacker
      who is able to insert the DNSSEC Bogus Extended Error into a packet
      could instead simply reply with a fictitious address (A or AAAA) record.

      Another author would like to thank the band "Mushroom Infectors". This
      was funny at the time we wrote it, but we cannot remember why...</t>
