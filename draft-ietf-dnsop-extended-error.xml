    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an extensible method to return
      additional information about the cause of DNS errors. Though
      created primarily to extend SERVFAIL to provide additional
      information about the cause of DNS and DNSSEC failures, the
      Extended DNS Errors option defined in this document allows all
      response types to contain extended error information.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction and background">
      <t>There are many reasons that a DNS query may fail, some of
      them transient, some permanent; some can be resolved by querying
      another server, some are likely best handled by stopping
      resolution.  Unfortunately, the error signals that a DNS server
      can return are very limited, and are not very expressive. This
      means that applications and resolvers often have to "guess" at
      what the issue is - e.g. was the answer marked REFUSED because
      of a lame delegation, or because the nameserver is still
      starting up and loading zones? Is a SERVFAIL a DNSSEC validation
      issue, or is the nameserver experiencing a bad hair day?</t>

      <t>A good example of issues that would benefit by additional error
      information are errors caused by DNSSEC validation issues. When a stub
      resolver queries a DNSSEC bogus name (using a validating resolver), the
      stub resolver receives only a SERVFAIL in response. Unfortunately,
      SERVFAIL is used to signal many sorts of DNS errors, and so the stub
      resolver simply asks the next configured DNS resolver. The result of
      trying the next resolver is one of two outcomes: either the next
      resolver also validates, a SERVFAIL is returned again, and the user gets
      an (largely) incomprehensible error message; or the next resolver is not
      a validating resolver, and the user is returned a potentially harmful
      result.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to extend (or annotate) DNS
      errors to provide additional information about the cause of the error.
      When properly authenticated, this information can be used by the
      resolver to make a decision regarding whether or not to retry or it can
      be used or by technical users attempting to debug issues.</t>

    <section title="Use of the Extended DNS Error option">
      <t>The Extended DNS Error (EDE) is an EDNS option. It can be included in
      any response (SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, REFUSED, etc) to a query that
      includes an EDNS option. This document includes a set of initial
      codepoints (and requests to the IANA to add them to the registry), but
      is extensible via the IANA registry to allow additional error and
      information codes to be defined in the future.</t>

      <t>The fields of the Extended DNS Error option are defined
      further in the following sub-sections.</t>

      <section title="The R (Retry) flag">
          <t>The R (Retry) flag provides a hint as to what the
          receiver may want to do with this annotated
          error. Specifically, the R (or Retry) flag provides a hint
          to the receiver that it should retry the query to another
          server. If the R bit is set (1), the sender believes that
          retrying the query may provide a successful answer next
          time; if the R bit is clear (0), the sender believes that
          the resolver should not ask another server.</t>

          <t>The mechanism is specifically designed to be extensible,
          and so implementations may receive EDE codes that it does
          not understand. The R flag allows implementations to make a
          decision as to what to do if it receives a response with an
          unknown code - retry or drop the query. Note that this flag
          is only a suggestion. Unless a protective transport
          mechanism (like TSIG <xref target="RFC2845"/> or TLS <xref
          target="RFC8094"/>) is used, the bit's value could have have
          been altered by a person-in-the-middle. Receivers can choose
          to ignore this hint.  See the security considerations for
          additional considerations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The RESPONSE-CODE field">
	  <t>This 4-bit value SHOULD be a copy of the RCODE from the
	  primary DNS packet. Multiple EDNS0/EDE records may be
	  included in the response.  When including multiple EDNS0/EDE
	  records in a response in order to provide additional error
	  information, other RESPONSE-CODEs MAY use a different
	  RCODE.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The INFO-CODE field">
          <t>This 12-bit value provides the additional context for the
          RESPONSE-CODE value. This combination of the RESPONSE-CODE
          and the INFO-CODE serve as a joint-index into the IANA
          "Extended DNS Errors" registry.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The EXTRA-TEXT field">
          <t>The UTF-8-encoded, EXTRA-TEXT field may be zero-length,
          or may hold additional information useful to network
          operators.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Defined Extended DNS Errors">
      <t>This document defines some initial EDE codes. The mechanism
      is intended to be extensible, and additional code-points can be
      registered in the "Extended DNS Errors" registry. This document
      provides suggestions for the R flag, but the originating server
      may ignore these recommendations if it knows better.</t>

      <t>The RESPONSE-CODE and the INFO-CODE from the EDE EDNS option is used
      to serve as a double index into the "Extended DNS Error codes" IANA
      registry, the initial values for which are defined in the following
      sub-sections.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Though DNSSEC continues to be deployed, unfortunately a
      significant number of clients (~11% according to <xref
      target="GeoffValidation"/>) that receive a SERVFAIL from a
      validating resolver because of a DNSSEC validaion issue will
      simply ask the next (potentially non-validating) resolver in
      their list, and thus don't get any of the protections which
      DNSSEC should provide.  This is very similar to a kid asking his
      mother if he can have another cookie. When the mother says "No,
      it will ruin your dinner!", going off and asking his (more
      permissive) father and getting a "Yes, sure, have a
      cookie!".</t>

      <t>This information is unauthenticated information, and an attacker (e.g
      MITM or malicious recursive server) could insert an extended error
      response into already untrusted data &mdash; ideally clients and
      resolvers would not trust any unauthenticated information, but until we
      live in an era where all DNS answers are authenticated via DNSSEC or
      other mechanisms, there are some tradeoffs. As an example, an attacker
      who is able to insert the DNSSEC Bogus Extended Error into a packet
      could instead simply reply with a fictitious address (A or AAAA) record.
      The R bit hint and extended error information are informational -
      implementations can choose how much to trust this information and
      validating resolvers / stubs may choose to put a different weight on
      it.</t>

      <t>I also want to thank the band "Infected Mushroom" for providing a
      good background soundtrack (and to see if I can get away with this!)
      Another author would like to thank the band "Mushroom Infectors". This
      was funny at the time we wrote it, but I cannot remember why...</t>
