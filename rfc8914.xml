    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an extensible method to return
      additional information about the cause of DNS errors. Though
      created primarily to extend SERVFAIL to provide additional
      information about the cause of DNS and DNSSEC failures, the
      Extended DNS Errors option defined in this document allows all
      response types to contain extended error information. Extended
      DNS Error information does not change the processing of RCODEs.</t>

      <name>Introduction and Background</name>
      <t>There are many reasons that a DNS query may fail -- some of
      them transient, some permanent; some can be resolved by querying
      another server, some are likely best handled by stopping
      resolution.  Unfortunately, the error signals that a DNS server
      can return are very limited and are not very expressive. This
      means that applications and resolvers often have to "guess" at
      what the issue is, e.g., was the answer marked REFUSED because
      of a lame delegation or because the nameserver is still
      starting up and loading zones? Is a SERVFAIL a DNSSEC validation
      issue, or is the nameserver experiencing some other failure?
      What error messages should be presented to the user or logged
      under these conditions?</t>
      <t>A good example of issues that would benefit from additional
      error information are errors caused by DNSSEC validation
      issues. When a stub resolver queries a name that is DNSSEC
      bogus <xref target="RFC8499" format="default"/> (using a validating resolver),
      the stub resolver receives only a SERVFAIL in
      response. Unfortunately, the SERVFAIL Response Code (RCODE) is
      used to signal many sorts of DNS errors, and so the stub
      resolver's only option is to ask the next configured DNS
      resolver. The result of trying the next resolver is one of two
      outcomes: either the next resolver also validates and a
      SERVFAIL is returned again or the next resolver is not a
      validating resolver and the user is returned a potentially
      harmful result.  With an Extended DNS Error (EDE) option
      enclosed in the response message, the resolver is able to return
      a more descriptive reason as to why any failures happened or
      add additional context to a message containing a NOERROR
      RCODE.</t>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to extend DNS errors to
      provide additional information about the cause of an error.
      The Extended DNS Error codes described in this document
      can be used by any system that sends DNS queries and receives a
      response containing an EDE option. Different codes are useful
      in different circumstances, and thus different systems (stub
      resolvers, recursive resolvers, and authoritative resolvers)
      might receive and use them.</t>

      <t>When the response grows beyond the requestor's UDP payload
      size <xref target="RFC6891" format="default"/>, servers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> truncate messages
      by dropping EDE options before dropping other data from packets.
      Implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> set the truncation bit when dropping EDE
      options.  Because long EXTRA-TEXT fields may trigger truncation
      (which is undesirable given the supplemental nature of
      EDE), implementers and operators creating EDE options <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
      avoid lengthy EXTRA-TEXT contents.</t>
      <t>When a resolver or forwarder receives an EDE option, whether
      or not (and how) to pass along EDE information on to their
      original client is implementation dependent. Implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
      choose to not forward information, or they <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose to create
      a new EDE option(s) that conveys the information encoded in the
      received EDE.  When doing so, the source of the error <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
      attributed in the EXTRA-TEXT field, since an EDNS0 option
      received by the original client will appear to have come from
      the resolver or forwarder sending it.</t>
      <t>This document does not allow or prohibit any particular
      extended error codes and information to be matched with any
      particular RCODEs. Some combinations of extended error codes and
      RCODEs may seem nonsensical (such as resolver-specific extended
      error codes in responses from authoritative servers), so systems
      interpreting the extended error codes <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> assume that a
      combination will make sense.  Receivers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to accept
      EDE codes and EXTRA-TEXT in all messages, including those with a
      NOERROR RCODE but need not act on them.  Applications <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      continue to follow requirements from applicable specifications on how to
      process RCODEs no matter what EDE values are also received.
      Senders <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include more than one EDE option and receivers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      be able to accept (but not necessarily process or act on)
      multiple EDE options in a DNS message.</t>

      <t>Though DNSSEC continues to be deployed, unfortunately a
      significant number of clients (~11% according to <xref target="GeoffValidation" format="default"/>) that receive a SERVFAIL from a
      validating resolver because of a DNSSEC validation issue will
      simply ask the next (potentially non-validating) resolver in
      their list and thus don't get the protections that
      DNSSEC should provide.</t>
      <t>EDE information is unauthenticated information, unless
      secured by a form of secured DNS transaction, such as <xref
      target="RFC2845" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC2931"
      format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC8094" format="default"/>, or <xref
      target="RFC8484" format="default"/>. An attacker (e.g., a man in the
      middle (MITM) or malicious
      recursive server) could insert an extended error response into
      untrusted data -- although, ideally, clients and resolvers
      would not trust any unauthenticated information.  As such, EDE
      content should be treated only as diagnostic information and
      <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> alter DNS protocol processing.  Until all DNS answers
      are authenticated via DNSSEC or the other mechanisms mentioned
      above, there are some trade-offs. As an example, an attacker who
      is able to insert the DNSSEC Bogus Extended Error into a DNS
      message could instead simply reply with a fictitious address (A
      or AAAA) record.  Note that DNS RCODEs also
      contain no authentication and can be just as easily manipulated.
      </t>
      <t>By design, EDE potentially exposes additional information
      DNS resolution processes that may leak information. 
<!--[rfced] We are having some trouble parsing this sentence, particularly
because of the first instance of "information". Please let us know how we may
clairfy. 

Original:
   By design, EDE potentially exposes additional information DNS
   resolution processes that may leak information. 

Perhaps:

   resolution processes that may leak information. 

Or:

      An example
      of this is the Prohibited EDE code (18), which may leak the fact
      that the name is on a blacklist.</t>

      <t>One author also wants to thank the band Infected Mushroom
      for providing a good background soundtrack (and to see if he can
